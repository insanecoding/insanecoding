I'm Senior Frontend Developer at Omio travel booking platform (ex. GoEuro). I have 6+ years of experience and a Master's degree in Cyber Security. I mostly specialize in Javascript/Typescript, React stack (React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Webpack, Babel, Jest, PostCSS) and Svelte but always open to trying something new. I have a passion for cutting-edge frontend technologies as well as functional programming.

Apart from building beautiful and performant web apps, I really enjoy configuring complex frontend tools. If it is configurable, I'll do it! 
The bundlers are my passion. So far tried Webpack (including v5), Rollup, Parcel, Microbundle and Snowpack.
Writing configs is not a one-off for me. I don't stop investigating. It's always a joy to find a new plugin and cut off some more kilobytes from the resulting bundle.

In my software development practice, I stick to the following principles:
1) Don't simply close the tasks, try to understand the big picture behind them
2) Pick the right tool for the job
3) Avoid cargo culting and make informed decisions in every particular case
4) Don't be afraid of complex things with steep learning curves
5) Always keep your web apps small and performant
