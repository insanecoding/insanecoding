I'm a Senior Frontend Developer at Prose which is a custom hair care startup. I have 7+ years of experience and a Master's degree in Cyber Security. I mainly specialize in Javascript/Typescript and React stack (React with or without hooks, Redux, Next.js, Webpack, Babel, Jest, PostCSS). But I like Svelte, too. I'm always open to trying something new. I have a passion for cutting-edge frontend technologies as well as functional programming. 

I'm a big fan of Graphql. I invested a lot into learning all the ins and outs of the Apollo Client. Then, I successfully refactored the data layer of the existing user management app. I improved the code structure, upgraded Apollo to the next major version, and used its advanced features (local states, Apollo links, REST API integration, type generation from the Graphql schema).

Apart from building beautiful and performant web apps, I really enjoy configuring complex frontend tools. If it is configurable, I'll do it! 
The bundlers are my passion. So far tried Webpack (including v5), Rollup, Parcel, Microbundle and Snowpack.
Writing configs is not a one-off for me. I don't stop investigating. It's always a joy to find a new plugin and cut off some more kilobytes from the resulting bundle.

I try to give back to the community. I reported issues in use-async-resource, size-limit and react router. I made PRs to several webpack plugins (html-webpack-banner-plugin and inline-manifest-webpack-plugin). I want to be even more active in future.

In my software development practice, I stick to the following principles:
1) Don't simply close the tasks, try to understand the big picture behind them
2) Pick the right tool for the job
3) Avoid cargo culting and make informed decisions in every particular case
4) Don't be afraid of complex things with steep learning curves
5) Always keep your web apps small and performant
